## Overview of the Project

# Screenshot of main page coming soon.
 
This project is a Medical AI tool that is designed to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing diseases based on symptoms and test results. The tool uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze patient data and provide a diagnosis with a high degree of accuracyMedical AI is a critical tool for disease diagnosis because it can help healthcare professionals make more accurate and faster diagnoses. By using machine learning algorithms, medical AI can analyze vast amounts of medical data, including patient histories, test results, and imaging studies, to identify patterns and make predictions about the presence of specific diseases. This helps to improve the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, which can lead to earlier treatment and better health outcomes for patients. Additionally, medical AI can assist healthcare professionals in making complex diagnoses that would otherwise be challenging to identify. Overall, medical AI has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. 

## Key Features
 
* Automated diagnostic tool that provides a fast and accurate diagnosis
* Integration with Microsoft Azure, Python, Kaggle, and APIs to access and analyze patient data
* Supports data formats like JSON and XML
* Robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
* Advanced security features to protect patient data and information

## Build With 

* Python
* TensorFlow

## Web

- PHP for the frame work of the website.
- CSS for styling the GUI and Display.
- Javascripting, Json, and XML to fetch , used data to store and transmit data, and to represent data
- BootStrap framework for developing responsive forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.
- API Socket to collection of socket calls that enables to perform the following primary communication functions between application programs:
## Requirements

* Microsoft Azure account
* Python 3+
* Kaggle API key
* API documentation (if available)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Set up a Microsoft Azure account and obtain an API key
3. Obtain a Kaggle API key
4. Install required dependencies using pip or conda
5. Run the tool using the command line interface or a Python IDE
